# Data Engineering Assessment Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to a multi-part SQL and Python data engineering assessment. The tasks demonstrate skills in SQL querying, window functions, CTEs, data validation, ETL-style Python scripting, pipeline design, and distributed data processing concepts.

## Contents

### SQL Tasks
- **Task 1:** Identify Error → Normal state transitions using self-joins and timestamp logic  
- **Task 2:** Calculate a 7-day running average using window functions with a date-based RANGE  
- **Task 3:** Return the latest version of each employee contact record using ROW_NUMBER and CTEs  

### Python Tasks
- **Task 4:** Validate nested event log dictionaries  
- **Task 5:** Filter transactions from the current year using generators  
- **Task 6:** Safely divide numeric IDs by 10 with input validation


## Skills Demonstrated
- SQL joins, window functions, and CTEs  
- Python scripting for ETL and data validation  
- Data quality checks and defensive programming  
- Understanding of distributed systems and storage formats  
- Pipeline design, idempotency, and dependency management  

## What I Learned
This project strengthened my ability to:
- Write clear, efficient SQL for real-world analytical patterns  
- Build Python functions that validate, transform, and stream data  
- Think like a data engineer when designing pipelines and handling failures 
- Choose appropriate tools for large-scale data processing  
- Communicate technical reasoning clearly and professionally
